# Note Taker 

## Description
An application that can be used to write and save notes. It uses an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was souced from [this repository](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka). I built the back end, connected it to the front end and deployed the entire application to Heroku.
